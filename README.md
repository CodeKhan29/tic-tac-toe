# Tic-Tac-Toe  

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where participants take turns marking a 3x3 grid with either an X or an O. The objective is to be the first to place three of your marks in a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, this game has been implemented using React and CSS.
